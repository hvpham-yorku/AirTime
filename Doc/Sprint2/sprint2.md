### Note:
Since all documentation for this sprint was completed by Hena (excluding `Daily Stand-up.md` and `PB.md`) with limited communication from other team members (often being left on read or unanswered), I (Hena) am not fully aware of the completed work done by teammates. Additionally, the features implemented by teammates are not functioning as expected and require fixes to work properly.
