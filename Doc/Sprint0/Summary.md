Summary of AirTime

The main objective of this flight booking system is to provide a user-friendly interface through which users can navigate efficiently using Java Swing. The information related to flights is contemplated to be at the discretion of the administrator's management; it is expected that the administrator will add, delete, and update all flight-related information. The system is able to allow a customer to search for available flights, book a flight, and perform some efficient captures of important information like seat selection and costs. Java is used for back-end development while having a strong link to a MySQL database for storing and retrieving data gives a high light on the security aspect through user authentication, allowing only authorized personnel to have access to the management features.

Key Use Cases of the System The key use cases that are possible in the system are: In the system, admins can log in to the system using valid credentials. Admins will be able to use the admin features, such as addition, deletion, and editing of flights, in order to keep the database updated with latest data. Customers would then utilize the functionality of key searching, for instance, flights based on given criteria that would populate options and then make bookings once one flight has been selected, thereby recording key information in the booking database.

A few of the usage scenarios, in fact, highlighted how the system was going to work. The admin logs into the application, enters flight management, and starts adding or deleting flights. A user can access the application, search for flights by inserting his traveling details, and then book the selected flight by filling in his/her information in order to confirm a purchase. Another important aspect of the application is error handling. If a customer tries to book an option in a flight that has already been taken, then this should be handled elegantly by the system with an error message and asking him to choose another option.

Target audiences of the flight booking system include administrators who will maintain the data about flights, and customers wanting to search for and book flights. These will also be useful in understanding how architecture and functionality shall go forward for enhancements to be made by developers and maintainers of the system.

Principles that have been upheld while guiding the development and functionalities of this system include a few. Usability will be one of the main concerns; it shows easiness for admin and customer interfaces. Security will be one of the main priorities, by using strong authentication mechanisms in order to safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access. Reliability stresses error handling and keeps up performance consistently. It must be scalable in order to meet future enhancements and enlarged user capacity. Last but not least, integrity means that data stored within the database is accurate and consistent; hence, whatever data represented through the system can be trusted by the user.
