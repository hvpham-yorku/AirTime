Reflect on how your team worked together.
    In general, our team collaboration was great, though there were some difficulties. First of all, we had a communication problem at the very beginning, basically because one member did not answer anything at first; it was a big slowdown for our project progress. Later, we found out that this person was no longer in our team, and it explained some frustrations right at the beginning. These finally overcome, it set us into a position whereby more productive use of our time and energy flowed into our work, supporting each other through things and moving the process along so much more easily. What we picked up from this experience is that clear composition and early communication are very significant in any team, something we shall be keen on in our future collaborations.


How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
    The team was organized concerning the members' expertise and strengths, so each had the opportunity to contribute in those areas of the project where their knowledge was best. This helped us to be more productive because each one could develop aspects of the project that were more in concordance with his experience. We used Discord for communication to update all members on the project, divide up tasks, and communicate questions. Above setup worked for us since Discord allowed us to do both text and voice communications; therefore, more dynamic discussions were really enabled.


How did you make decisions?
    Our decision-making was mainly based on deliberations and voting where need be. Options were weighed together, with each of the team members having had an opportunity to air their view. Where there would be open options, we would use the majority vote option, which would enable us to go ahead with the decision that suited the majority members. This approach ensured that all the team members' contributions were captured, with also saving ourselves from stalling the project on grounds of indecision.


How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting
(on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
    In this project, we prioritized and assigned each user story with a point value based on how much the user story impacts the core functionality of the flight booking system and the user experience. Our priority listing also considered technical dependencies that require the building blocks to be created first so that more complex features can be supported.

    Priority Definition
        Core Functionalities First: Stories vital for the system to work, such as the login of a user, creating an account, flight search, and booking, are rated as most important because they represent the backbone of activating stories of the booking process.
        
        Admin Controls and Flight Management: The admin controls were the next level in priority, stories 17, 18, and 19, in order to make sure flight details are accurate and manageable, which is crucial for the integrity of the system and the reliability of the service.
        
        Advanced User Features: The filtering of flights-features 6, 7, and 8-viewing transaction history, story 12, and travel insurance, story 15-were lower in priority, as these are features enhancing but not touching the core functionality of booking.
        
        System and Admin Management: The system management-related stories - 16, 20, 21, and the advanced administrative controls were the 
        lowest priority, as they don't affect the customer's immediate experience in booking.
    
    For each story, we provided points based on its complexity and the estimated time it took to resolve each one. Actually, it took a couple of rounds of voting before consensus on story points was reached. In fact, two rounds on average were enough for the team members to reach a consensus, as each member was given the opportunity to explain their estimate.

How frequently did you meet?
    We met a few times during this sprint to discuss ideas, share the progress and clear our doubts regarding the project. In fact, we should have had more frequent meetings to really serve us effectively in brainstorming, aligning on project goals, and updating each other on our work. Regular discussions in the future will help us to start solving problems immediately and not let the project fall behind schedule.


What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
    From this stage, we have learned that early and systematic consideration of every phase of the project is necessary for clarity among all team members from day one. In future, we shall make sure that each of the given requirements are completed well in advance so we are able to re-write and handle any mishaps along the way. Also, regular follow-ups shall be carried out with the group members to ensure all of us are on the same page about a project. We will also underline the importance of open communication regarding what has been changed or updated to keep everyone informed and avoid confusion. These are sure to be very important lessons for our effectiveness and team harmony for this project's sprints.
