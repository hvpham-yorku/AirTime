Competitors to our online flight booking system include, but are not limited to; Air Canada (https://www.aircanada.com/home/ca/en/aco/flights), Expedia (https://www.Expedia.com), 
Google Flights (https://www.google.com/travel/flights?gl=CA&hl=en) and Skyscanner (https://www.skyscanner.ca). Each of these competitors have attempted to improve the quality of life for users in various ways. 
Whether that be by offering discounts/cheaper flights, different airlines and routes, or even through offering accommodation along with the flights. 
However, each of these systems have failed to solve one of the fundamental issues with online flight booking systems. That issue being overbooking customers. 

In our system, we will ensure that no flight will be overbooked. A customer that uses our system will always be guaranteed a seat on the flight they have booked, no matter what class they have booked. 
This fix is particularly good for economy users/lower income clients who might not have the luxury of affording the higher end, more secure and guaranteed tickets. We believe that this issue stems from a place of greed. 
Overbooking a flight ensures that it will be full, thus ensuring that the airlines and stakeholders get their moneys worth. However, it could also lead to unhappy customers, especially among the economy class 
which makes up for a large percentage of the total users. We believe that in the long run, this method and ideals will allow us to cultivate a large and loyal user base, something that was perhaps 
overlooked by our competitors.
